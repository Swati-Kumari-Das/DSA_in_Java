/*
Approach:
- This uses Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare approach).
- Maintain two pointers: 
    - `slow` moves one step at a time.
    - `fast` moves two steps at a time.
- If the linked list contains a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet.
- If `fast` or `fast.next` becomes null, it means the list has no cycle.

Time Complexity: O(n)
- Each node is visited at most twice (once by each pointer).

Space Complexity: O(1)
- No extra data structures are used; only two pointers are maintained.
